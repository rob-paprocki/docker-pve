#
# For each NAME.mmd it writes NAME-light.svg, NAME-dark.svg and NAME.svg (the
# one the README shows, which switches palette with the reader's theme).
#
# The tool versions are pinned in package.json and package-lock.json next to
# this script: @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli 12.0.0, mermaid 12.3.0, puppeteer
# 25.13.0. They are installed with `npm ci` into a temporary folder that is
# deleted afterwards, so nothing is added to the repository.
#
# Needs Node.js 22.13 or later, npm and python3. Puppeteer downloads its own
# Chrome on the first run (cached in ~/.cache/puppeteer). To use a Chrome or
# Chromium you already have instead, set PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH to it.
